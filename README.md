Mongo Express Typescript Node Rest and GraphQL Boilerplate
=========================

(based on [Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter) and [MEAN.js](https://github.com/meanjs/mean)):

DITTO.ts is a backend Typecript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript and Typescript components.
